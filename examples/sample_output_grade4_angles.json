    "explanation": "Angles are everywhere around us! When two lines meet at a point, they make an angle.\n\nThere are different types of angles based on how big they are. A right angle is like the corner of a book - it makes an 'L' shape. An acute angle is smaller than a right angle, like a slice of pizza. An obtuse angle is bigger than a right angle, like when you open a door wide.\n\nLearning about angles helps us understand shapes and spaces better!",
